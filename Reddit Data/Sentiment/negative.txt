hopefully supposed relocate house may th year certain member staff find extremely friendly supportive approachable stranger member staff come across weird creepy abusive controlling toxic excessively nice control bedroom furniture ugly modern white crap ikea hate would much rather posse old taste like get spend every time go eat cheese instead greek meal either pot noodle instant noodle vegan pasta n sauce cheese thing lunch always packed lunch also can not buy tub top ice cream someone would steal ice cream even put name hate always put name food drink otherwise someone steal get annoyed lot freedom order anything want net providing afford purchase age restricted product also providing money cigarette alcohol empty calorie neither vapes hate vaping gambling lottery crap appeal slightest go walk use public transport access internet bank account allowed keep card stored wallet safe read whatever book want play whatever video game want although would rather play fighting game ne p switch older video game age prefer old thing watch whatever film television want forth however past eg age freedom restricted due lockdown also history bad behavior allowed leave house member staff pay thing wanted buy behalf allowed use internet even allowed kind book often enjoy reading horror non fiction drug true crime even form psychology parental control iphone taken away due bad behavior get new one thankfully without parental control age inevitably restriction gradually lifted aged yes mentioned many staff ok literally every single young person ever share house nasty shape form point jealous left age year maybe even leave age year smth like short emo girl initially friendly first met eventually said nasty awful thing remember first probably last time drank alcohol life asked wanted temporarily run away home drink beer night abandoned shed remember talking drug feeling since age intense drug ever managed ingest caffeine like red bull dislike monster hate coffee nicotine green nutmeg nitrous olanzapine prescribed eating disorder anxiety blue garden variety street drug cocaine mdma lsd telling experience mdma cause best euphoria ever told pot habit certain staff member certain young people home sheltered year old shocked point offered lsd buy drug time bank account cash locked away safe told would give pregnancy test behalf one friend young dumb naive order never given lsd looking back hindsight would never take kind un tested unless god know street drug like could laced actually good thing never got ingest lsd circumstance temporarily addicted crap chocolate pill lighter tried get high except effect remember incident happened left bathroom approached stared said say goodbye laptop nasty tone laptop trusted internet said something along line short cm tall transgender male probably cm tall time said think sentence two meaning short male also metaphorically short therefore powerless kind friend also falling regular basis somehow chavvy girl also quite short never liked living also jealous would somehow eat one meal day toy fail finish slightly overweight fat shamed slightly underweight due eating disorder would comment chest still similar kind bmi although chest massively small still large enough pronounced speak also remember contemplating religious belief lot religious belief always vague weird combination roman went roman catholic primary school always kind believed still entirely sure true think one can not prove god exists neither one prove god exist older somewhat certain aspect really wanted atheist thought would make look cool intelligent lot tried hardest convince religion b cognitive dissonance resulted cry therefore chavvy girl would make fun religious belief eg remember time got hit car crossing road go hospital get found said come flying towards help god helped name beloved stuffed sheep owned life sleep every night remember christmas time tossed bunch head said something angel also remember describing clown suggesting find behavior action extremely stupid ridiculous point funny also remember fat girl really loud like female lived kind person would wear time look woman would rather wear short suit skirt dress listen pop music capital radio ate lot food took great pleasure eating found obnoxious remember car two member staff stating wanted house dog disagreed added would rather cat responded cat would bite would scream like baby hurt feeling remember chavvy boy although friendly first met eventually turned complete would wear load stupid ugly trainer would talk every time expressed even smallest amount emotion would say fit hate word find offensive four people longer live home currently living one girl one boy aged respectively hate former adhd anger issue often thrash stomp around house loud reason annoys think short fat ugly stupid feminine bad everything high pitched voice latter le male equivalent punch bedroom door apparent reason therefore adult always sit corridor otherwise thrash bedroom door get reaction night rather shitty fucking hate whenever people talk corridor bedroom want complete peace quiet can not wait house must always control environment

music alternative rock band sonic youth video game u share interest personality typology however one discovered first decided shove throat confident opinion typology typed w sx sp easily tell fact like late early emo scene aesthetic vegan weird unpopular opinion study art college keep emotion although everyone net type sx believe slightest think infj w sp sx elaborate rest typology system belief mbti paracosm feel different sensor understand sensor according must find certain word country website food song etc funny instead joke use vocabulary bedroom film television grocery shopping instead room movie tv phone food shopping respectively hate strongly prefer thing older decade etc psychologist although think mbti used people aged year older go year without taking kind personality test order get accurate result exclusively workplace setting think typology system example complete bullshit also good opinion think highly intelligent deep thinker although kind comment also feel though lying make feel better done iq assessment result slightly average autism could higher bear mind iq test minor cringe much year old self seemed dumb iq know actually intelligent adult small number fellow adolescent friendly mature non asshole one brother opinion young people especially aged le year nasty shitty bad opinion think stupid even want perceived intelligent first place whenever around group home kid get called r word get called dickhead get called c get called autistic rat get called weirdo someone please help think gone bedroom corridor fuck sake open bedroom door call get
