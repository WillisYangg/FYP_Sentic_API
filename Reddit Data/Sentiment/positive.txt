eight year progress gone blink eye still fully recovered decade later xb losing eight year progress true extent damage went back started worse ever would freeze tiniest thing able get teacher staff idea help ultimately made worse sent home multiple occasion could tell going get anywhere described catatonic calling parent spend grade sitting office nothing least five hour day xb math teacher called office every time froze even bothering literally one teaching assistant class well science one would come sitting nothing try work one one would still freeze sometimes two u remember vividly saying went way help froze choice somehow science teacher specially trained kid mental health issue somehow supportive understanding staff whole grade year eventually got year high school xb already knew going thing sent town public high school school around student time gave one one aid follow around day every day made thing worse better math teacher school also sucked would frequently say refusing work whenever froze three staff member surrounding audacity tell making scene sent home multiple time well eventually decided needed therapeutic school guess evidence needed sure middle school enough hint whatever one people meeting commented amazing able get get school every day xb although notice time moderately sure experiencing sa time well overshadowed constant freezing mom began searching school could go started constantly venting complaining hard would make friend new school know anyone talked often mom started get irritated hindsight probably evidence sa gotten worse since reading giver fall prior giver made entirely new friend friend group two three time eventually settled school nobody town heard including therapist psychiatrist xb school around student fact
